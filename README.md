## Problem definition

    1. Having to physically queue in line or waiting for hour in waiting rooms and crowded
    lobbies has grown to be a major community problem

    2. The model of waiting in lines is very inefficient, customers have to be in line in
    order to be served even if the line may have more than a hundred customers ahead.

    3. Despite this fact, service-based organizations that have the longest waiting time are
    making very little effort to improve on it.

    4. Needed is a system which allows queue management to be provided as a service and
    customers can accurately estimate their wait times and keep them updated as the queue
    progresses without having to wait in the premise or crowded lobbies.

## Scope

    1. The scope of the developed system Project is planning, designing, developing, and
    implementing a Restful API where all virtual queues would be managed and a mobile application
    for booking tokens.

    2. The system would also provide access to an administrator dashboard with key metrics for
    showing various reports and statistics on status of queues and also permissions that would enable
    authorized users to update, manage, and view queues.

    3. Administrative dashboards would also contain daily queue statistics, call centers,
    Department data, counter and staff data and Reports view.

    4. The mobile app is to provide a list of service centers and booking options

    5. System will provide users notification regarding their current position and queue.

    6. The application will allow the organization to broadcast some message to their customer or
    manually notify the customer.
